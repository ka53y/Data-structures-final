You will be prompted to enter a word a good word to show the full usability including the for honors contract is: anthro
A good word to prove that the for honor contract only works when the first letter is in the dictionary is: zeta
after entering a word the program will determine if the word is in the dictionary if the word is not in the dictionary and the first letter is then the program will provide a spell check listing all the words that start with that letter asking if you meant any of those
the prompt will be y or n inputs and if you type y the program returns true and lists all the recommended words again if n then the program returns false without listing the words
the time it takes to search the hash table is roughly 50 ms but with the user inputs I averaged 3000000ms 
to test the time without the for honor extra inputs there are comments on line 94 and 119 changes those to the block comments and change the found variable on line 76 to 1
I wasnt sure how to implement your time header so I used one that I got off of a reference
